# Infix-Expression-to-Postfix-Conversion-and-Evaluation-using-Linked-Stacks
Write a C++ program that reads an infix expression from the user, converts it to postfix notation using a linked stack, and then evaluates the postfix expression to obtain its value. The program should make use of classes to implement the linked stack data structure.
